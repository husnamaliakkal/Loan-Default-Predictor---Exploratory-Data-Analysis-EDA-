# Loan-Default-Predictor---Exploratory-Data-Analysis-EDA-
Lending companies often struggle with lending decisions due to applicants with insufficient credit history. This can lead to defaults. In this case study, I perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a loan application dataset to understand patterns and minimize loan defaults while ensuring deserving applicants are not rejected.
The primary goal is to identify patterns indicating clients struggling with loan repayments. This insight informs actions such as loan denial, adjusting loan amounts, or offering loans to risky applicants at higher interest rates. The company aims to enhance portfolio management and risk assessment by understanding key variables influencing loan default. This repository contains EDA code and resources for making informed lending decisions and reducing default risks.
